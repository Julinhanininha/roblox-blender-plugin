# Contributing

Roblox is providing this plugin source as a *reference* implementation. Our goal is to illustrate how Open Cloud APIs can be used to create integrations with external tools.

Our hope is the community leverages this reference implementation to build their own tools and extensions. We actively encourage anybody who wishes to extend this reference implementation with new features to fork this repository and share their work with the community.

As such, we will *not* be accepting Pull Requests that introduce new features or functionality. However, in the interests of ensuring this plugin remains a functional reference implementation we will be accepting Pull Requests for bug fixes.

## Pull Request Guidance
